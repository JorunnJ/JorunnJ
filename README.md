Hi, I’m @JorunnJ! 

I study software engineering at Linköpings university. My GitHub repositories are a mix of serious projects that I've made for courses at University, and small personal projects that I've worked on.

keepcalmshithappens/keepcalmshithappens is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
